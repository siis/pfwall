this directory contains userspace setup and tools for the Process Firewall. 

PREREQUISITES
=============

the process firewall runs on top of SELinux. 
	$ apt-get install selinux 
		- NOTE: confirm that the initramfs for the pfwall kernel is regenerated. 
	- (after reboot) $ apt-get install selinux-policy-ubuntu

INSTALL
=======
To setup the filesystem:
	$ make install

this installs 
	- the process firewall daemon (pfwd) that generates the log file at /var/log/pfw.log
	- information to unwind interpreters (currently, bash and php are supported)

USAGE
=====
To allow interpreter unrolling: 
	$ cat /etc/pfwall/interpreter_info > /sys/kernel/debug/interpreter_info

To push rules into the kernel:
	$ pftables/pftables.py -h # for usage and an example
	$ ./pftables.py -l rules/examples/log # file containing rules to log everything

	- NOTE: the binary is translated into its inode number when the rule is pushed into the kernel. if you recompile the binary, please reload the rule so processes using the new binary image are monitored. 
	- NOTE: the output is in JSON. The array of 'entry' is the user stack backtrace. the offset is from the base of the binary (absolute address varies due to aslr).
