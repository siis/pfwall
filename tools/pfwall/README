This directory contains userspace setup and tools for the Process Firewall.  It is recommended to install Process Firewall on Ubuntu 12.04.

PREREQUISITES
=============
Process Firewall runs on top of SELinux. 
  $ apt-get install selinux 
    - NOTE: confirm that the initramfs for the pfwall kernel is regenerated.
  $ reboot
  $ apt-get install selinux-policy-ubuntu

Build and boot the Process Firewall kernel
  $ (go to the root directory of this repository)
  $ make menuconfig
    - NOTE: or you can use the current config: cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
  $ make
  $ make modules_install
  $ make install
    - NOTE: confirm grub.cfg is updated accordingly
  $ (boot the new kernel)
    - NOTE: execute "uname -r" to check if the pfwall kernel is booted

INSTALL
=======
To setup the user-space tools:
  $ make install
    - the process firewall daemon pfwd that generates the log file at /var/log/pfw.log
    - information to unwind interpreters (currently, bash and php are supported)
  $ reboot
    - NOTE: confirm the daemon process pfwd is running now
    - NOTE: confirm pfwall is enabled by "cat /sys/kernel/debug/pfwall_enabled"

AN EXAMPLE
==========
  $ cat /etc/pfwall/interpreter_info > /sys/kernel/debug/interpreter_info
    - this enables interpreter unrolling
  $ pftables/pftables.py -h 
    - for usage
  $ pftables/pftables.py -l rules/examples/log
    - file containing rules to log everything
    - NOTE: after awhile, check the pfwall log file /var/log/pfw.log

  - NOTE: the binary is translated into its inode number when the rule is pushed into the kernel. if you recompile the binary, please reload the rule so processes using the new binary image are monitored. 
  - NOTE: the output is in JSON. The array of 'entry' is the user stack backtrace. the offset is from the base of the binary (absolute address varies due to aslr).
