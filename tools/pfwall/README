this directory contains userspace setup and tools for the Process Firewall. 

To setup the filesystem:
	$ make install

this installs the process firewall daemon (pfwd) that generates the log file at /var/log/pfw.log

To push rules into the kernel:
	$ pftables/pftables.py -h # for usage and an example
	$ ./pftables.py -i rules/examples/log # file containing rules to log everything
